                    <p>Network Security Assessment is an evaluation to identify gaps and vulnerabilities in your network, 
                        help you validate your configuration and patch management, and identify steps you can take to improve 
                        your information security. The assessment helps you meet your minimum security needs.</p>
                    <h3>Our assessment strategy rests on basic requirements for system and network security. There are five key variables / characteristics 
                        that the network should possess:</h3>

                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"style="color:purple"></span><b>Security Policy:</b>Networks should have a defined rules, laws and practices that specifies information security requirements (e.g., integrity , confidentiality, availability, auditing, access control, etc.) as well as what users may and may not do on the network (e.g., what constitutes unauthorized and illegal activities).</p><br/>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"style="color:purple"></span><b>Network Management:</b>Networks should be able to control access to and detect modifications of critical components. Networks must maintain control over their configuration (e.g., hardware, software, security, etc.) and connectivity. </p><br/>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"style="color:purple"></span><b>Identification and Authentication:</b>Networks should provide and manage identification and authentication functions. </p><br/>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"style="color:purple"></span><b>Resources Management:</b>Networks should provide and manage confidentiality, integrity, access control, and availability of network resource </p><br/>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"style="color:purple"></span><b>Account Management:</b>Networks should provide and manage security-related features of network accounts (e.g., user). </p><br/>

                    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
                    <p>Our primary focus for the network security assessment (also known as a security audit or security review) is identifying network vulnerabilities that an active hostile human threat might exploit. With hundreds of applications and systems across your environment with access to the Internet, maintaining and updating system operating systems and applications to eliminate vulnerabilities is paramount especially when those applications and systems are tied to sensitive Student, Examination, courses or cardholder information. Our assessment is focused in-depth analysis of technical vulnerabilities.</p>
