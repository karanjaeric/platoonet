            <p>Biometric access control uses unique elements of a human body to identify who to grant access.
                For example, door access control can be done with the use of a fingerprint scanner. First, 
                the authorized finger prints are scanned and fed into a database. After that, a finger print reader is placed near the door.
                Anyone who wants entry puts their finger on the reader and only
                those who are authorized are granted access.</p>
